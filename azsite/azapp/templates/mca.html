        <h1>Microsoft Customer Agreement (MCA)</h1>

        <p>The Microsoft Customer Agreement is a billing account that allows indivuals to create up to 20 subscriptions, or an unlimited number of subscriptions for organizations. This agreement allows users to organize costs by department, team, or project. To do this, you use billing profiles, each of which represents an invoice, tracks your payment methods (credit card, Azure credits, and check/wire transfer information if you've been approved), and stores information about the billing address. Through our billing profiles, we can create invoice sections, which are used to assign subscriptions to departments/teams so that we can view the resource costs for a particular group. We can also apply policies to control Azure Marketplace and Reservation purchases using a billing profile. Lastly, an invoice is generated on the beginning of the month for each billing profile that contains the charges from the previous month, and Microsoft Azure Plan as well as Microsoft Azure Plan for Dev/Test are supported in MCA billing accounts.
