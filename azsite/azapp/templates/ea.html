        <h1>Enterprise Agreement (EA)</h1>

        <p>The Enterprise Agreement features a billing account that can contain one or more departments and accounts. The invoice for this agreement is generated at the billing account's scope, and this billing account also contains information about payment methods. Departments are used to represent different areas within an enterprise and are useful for logically grouping costs as well as settings budgets for reporting purposes. Accounts represent a single account owner, and therefore have permission to create and manage azure subscriptions that are billed to the billing account. With this agreement, the Enterprise Administrator can create or remove departments, create new enterprise administrators, associate accounts to departments, create Department Administrators, and allow these Department Administrators to view price and costs.
