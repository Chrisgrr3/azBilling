        <h1>Microsoft Online Services Program (MOSP)</h1>

        <p>The Microsoft Online Services Program utilizes a single billing account to represent the Microsoft Online Subscription Agreement with Azure. This billing account is tied to the Account Administrator and can contain one or more subscriptions, and for each subscription, an invoice is generated at the subscription's scope. Billing information such as payment methods and usage address are also associated with this scope, and it is possible to set different payment methods for different subscriptions. The billing period that is reflected depends on the date that the subscription was started. For instance, if a user with an MOSP billing account creates a subscription on June 16th, and period will run from then until July 15th. This user is set to receive their invoice on the 16th of each month, but it could arrive up to two days later.
